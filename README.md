Sales REvenue Prediction: THis project is about Business Forecasting, which aims to forecast future sales, expenditure, or revenue by using the historical Time Series data generated by the business. I worked on predicting the quarterly revenue of Adidas. The data I am using for this task is collected manually from quarterly sales reports from Adidas, and can be found here: https://statso.io/quarterly-revenue-analysis-case-study/ The Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model was used to forecast the quarterly sales revenue of Adidas.
